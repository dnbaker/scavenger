Ideas to try

0. Diffusion model for genetic pretraining

0b. Diffusion model for spatially resolved

1. Scaling loss by variance of genes (or a variation of it)

2. Pretrain individually, then fine-tune using local data pooled with graph nn

3. Predict what it should look like to match data across types.
